 * sending request cannot be successful without receiving the response, so send_status does not only send the request (in form of status)
 * but also waits for the response (in form of command).
 * Function is blocking, it will wait until command is received or timeout specified by an argument is reached before returning.
 * The timeout is set for sending status and receiving command, therefore maximum duration of this function is 2x timeout
 * After successful send_status call, command can be retrieved by get_command function.

 * otherwise NO_COMMAND_AVAILABLE is returned.

 * The "command" buffer structure must be initialized.
 * If command->size_in_bytes == 0, the data pointer will be allocated for the required size.
